# Docling Layout Analysis - Research Summary

## Introduction

This document summarizes the research findings for a tool or library named "Docling" intended for document layout analysis, as per TASK-023. The goal was to identify its capabilities, setup, and usage for the 'transcritor-pdf' project.

## Findings for "Docling"

Initial research, including searches on GitHub (for "Docling layout analysis") and attempts at broader web searches, did not yield any specific, publicly available tool, library, or documentation for a layout analysis system explicitly named "Docling."

Possible reasons for this include:
- "Docling" might be a proprietary or internal tool not available for public use.
- It could be a research project that is not widely published or is known by a different name.
- It might be a feature within a larger, less specifically named document processing suite.
- The name might have been a placeholder or a potential candidate that was not pursued.

## Conclusion for "Docling"

As of the time of this research, a direct, usable layout analysis tool named "Docling" has not been identified.

## Recommendations for TASK-016

Given that "Docling" was not found, TASK-016 ("F2: Pesquisar e implementar an√°lise de layout com Docling *ou similar*") should proceed with the following approach:
1.  **Broaden the search:** Investigate well-known open-source Python libraries and cloud-based APIs for document layout analysis. Examples to explore could include:
    *   **LayoutParser:** A Python library for document image analysis, including layout detection using various models.
    *   **Detectron2:** A platform for object detection and segmentation, which can be trained for layout analysis.
    *   **OCR-specific tools with layout features:** Libraries like `pytesseract` (with appropriate Page Segmentation Modes) or cloud services (Google Cloud Vision API, Azure AI Document Intelligence) often provide layout information (bounding boxes for paragraphs, lines, words).
    *   **PDF parsing libraries:** Some advanced PDF libraries might offer structure or block-level information.
2.  **Evaluate alternatives:** Based on ease of integration, performance, accuracy, and cost (if applicable), select a suitable alternative.
3.  **Document the chosen alternative:** Create a new summary file in `docs/reference/` for the selected tool, similar to what was intended for `docling_summary.txt`.

This approach will help fulfill the objectives of incorporating layout analysis into the 'transcritor-pdf' project as outlined in the roadmap.
