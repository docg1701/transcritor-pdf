### Descrição

Research official documentation for Redis, focusing on its use as a message broker for Celery. Identify key concepts, setup, configuration, and best practices relevant to its planned use with Celery in the 'transcritor-pdf' project. Create a summary reference file named `docs/reference/redis_summary.txt`.

### Critérios de Aceitação

- [x] Official documentation website(s) for Redis identified and accessed (redis.io, Celery docs, redis-py docs).
- [x] Key information relevant to its use as a Celery broker (setup, configuration for Celery, persistence options if any needed, basic commands for monitoring) reviewed.
- [x] Summary reference file `docs/reference/redis_summary.txt` created with key findings, relevant links, and configuration examples if applicable.

### Arquivos Relevantes

* `ROADMAP.md` (Phase 9)
* `requirements.txt` (if Redis client library is added)
* `docs/reference/redis_summary.txt`

### Relatório de Execução

Performed research on Redis, focusing on its use as a message broker and result backend for Celery.

Key areas researched include:

*   General Redis features, such as its in-memory nature, supported data structures (Lists, Pub/Sub, Streams relevant for messaging), and persistence mechanisms (RDB snapshots and AOF logs).
*   Installation procedures for a standalone Redis server (via official downloads, package managers like apt/yum/brew, and Docker).
*   Installation of the Python client `redis-py` (including the `hiredis` extra for performance) and the `celery[redis]` package for Celery integration.
*   Basic `redis-py` usage, covering connection establishment (including with `decode_responses=True` and connection pools) and common commands like `set`, `get`, `hset`, `hgetall`, `lpush`, `rpop`.
*   Celery configuration for Redis as a broker, detailing various `broker_url` formats (basic, with password, SSL, Unix socket).
*   Celery configuration for Redis as a result backend, using `result_backend` URL and recommending the use of a different DB number if on the same Redis instance.
*   Important Celery transport options for Redis, with a strong emphasis on `visibility_timeout` and its role in preventing tasks from being processed multiple times.
*   Redis persistence mechanisms (RDB and AOF), discussing their pros, cons, and general recommendations for Celery (AOF with `appendfsync everysec` for durability).
*   Basic Redis monitoring techniques, including `redis-cli monitor`, `redis-cli info`, and mentioning tools like Redis Insight.
*   Overall important considerations when using Redis with Celery, such as managing database numbers, understanding connection pooling, memory management, and task result expiry.

A comprehensive summary of these findings has been documented in `docs/reference/redis_summary.txt`. This summary includes explanations of relevant concepts, Python code examples for `redis-py`, Celery configuration examples (broker URL, transport options), and links to official documentation for Redis, `redis-py`, and Celery.
