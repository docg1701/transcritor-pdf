### Descrição

Research official documentation for Uvicorn. Identify key concepts, command-line options, programmatic usage, and configuration relevant to running the 'transcritor-pdf' FastAPI application, especially in a Docker environment. Create a summary reference file named `docs/reference/uvicorn_summary.txt`.

### Critérios de Aceitação

- [ ] Official Uvicorn documentation website(s) identified and accessed.
- [ ] Key information relevant to the project (running FastAPI apps, command-line arguments for host, port, workers, reload, SSL (if relevant in future), programmatic server startup, integration with FastAPI CLI) reviewed.
- [ ] Focus on recommended settings for production (e.g., number of workers) and development.
- [ ] Summary reference file `docs/reference/uvicorn_summary.txt` created with key findings, relevant links, and command/code examples.

### Arquivos Relevantes

* `ROADMAP.md` (Phase 7, 8)
* `requirements.txt` (uvicorn is part of fastapi[standard])
* `Dockerfile`
* `src/main.py` (if programmatic startup is considered)
* `docs/reference/uvicorn_summary.txt`

### Relatório de Execução

Researched the official Uvicorn documentation (https://www.uvicorn.org/).
Extracted key information regarding:
- Command-line usage for running FastAPI applications.
- Important CLI options like --host, --port, --workers, --reload.
- Programmatic server startup using uvicorn.run() and uvicorn.Config/uvicorn.Server.
- Configuration best practices for development and production.
- Notes on Docker integration, including Dockerfile examples and recommended command structures for running Uvicorn with and without Gunicorn.
Created the summary reference file docs/reference/uvicorn_summary.txt and populated it with the gathered information, including relevant links to the official documentation and command/code examples for each topic.
The summary covers how to run FastAPI applications with Uvicorn, focusing on CLI options, programmatic approaches, and considerations for Docker environments.
