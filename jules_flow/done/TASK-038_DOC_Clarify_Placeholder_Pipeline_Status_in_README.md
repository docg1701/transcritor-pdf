### Descrição

The main processing pipeline (`src/processing.py`) currently uses placeholder logic, simulating actual PDF processing. This contrasts with `ROADMAP.md` and `README.md` which imply full functionality. This needs to be made clear in the documentation.

### Critérios de Aceitação

- [ ] A prominent note is added to `README.md` (e.g., in 'Funcionalidades Principais' or a new 'Current Implementation Status' section).
- [ ] The note clearly states that the end-to-end pipeline in `src/processing.py` uses placeholder logic and that full processing functionality requires further development to integrate the existing component modules.

### Arquivos Relevantes

* `README.md`

### Relatório de Execução

Subtask completed successfully.
- Added a new section "Status Atual da Implementação" to `README.md`.
- This section clarifies that the main `process_pdf_pipeline` in `src/processing.py` currently uses placeholder logic.
- The note explains that full end-to-end functionality requires further development to integrate implemented component modules.
- It also mentions that API tests validate the interface/queueing, not the actual content processing.
This provides transparency about the project's current operational state.
