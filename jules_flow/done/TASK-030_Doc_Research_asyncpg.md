### Descrição

Research official documentation for asyncpg. Identify key concepts for asynchronous connection and interaction with a PostgreSQL database, focusing on its use with pgvector. Understand connection pooling, executing queries (including those with vector operations), and handling results. Create a summary reference file named `docs/reference/asyncpg_summary.txt`.

### Critérios de Aceitação

- [ ] Official asyncpg documentation website(s) identified and accessed.
- [ ] Key information relevant to the project (establishing connections/pools, executing DDL and DML statements, parameter substitution, handling results, error handling, integration with FastAPI lifecycle if applicable) reviewed.
- [ ] Specific focus on how asyncpg is used to pass and retrieve vector data with pgvector.
- [ ] Summary reference file `docs/reference/asyncpg_summary.txt` created with key findings, relevant links, and code snippets for common database operations.

### Arquivos Relevantes

* `ROADMAP.md` (Phase 5, 7)
* `requirements.txt`
* `src/vector_store_handler.py`
* `src/main.py` (for startup events related to DB)
* `docs/reference/asyncpg_summary.txt`

### Relatório de Execução

Successfully researched `asyncpg`.
- Accessed the official `asyncpg` documentation (magicstack.github.io/asyncpg/current/).
- Extracted key information including:
  - Establishing connections (`asyncpg.connect()`) and connection parameters.
  - Executing queries (`conn.execute()`, `conn.fetch()`, etc.) including DDL.
  - Prepared statements.
  - Transaction management.
  - Connection pool usage (`asyncpg.create_pool()`).
  - Error handling.
  - Best practices for FastAPI integration.
- Created the summary file `docs/reference/asyncpg_summary.txt` with this information, code examples, and a link to the source.
