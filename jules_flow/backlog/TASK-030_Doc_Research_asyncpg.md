### Descrição

Research official documentation for asyncpg. Identify key concepts for asynchronous connection and interaction with a PostgreSQL database, focusing on its use with pgvector. Understand connection pooling, executing queries (including those with vector operations), and handling results. Create a summary reference file named `docs/reference/asyncpg_summary.txt`.

### Critérios de Aceitação

- [ ] Official asyncpg documentation website(s) identified and accessed.
- [ ] Key information relevant to the project (establishing connections/pools, executing DDL and DML statements, parameter substitution, handling results, error handling, integration with FastAPI lifecycle if applicable) reviewed.
- [ ] Specific focus on how asyncpg is used to pass and retrieve vector data with pgvector.
- [ ] Summary reference file `docs/reference/asyncpg_summary.txt` created with key findings, relevant links, and code snippets for common database operations.
