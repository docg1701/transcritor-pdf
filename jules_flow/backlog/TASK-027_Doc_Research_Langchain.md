### Descrição

Research official Langchain documentation focusing on core concepts and usage patterns relevant to the 'transcritor-pdf' project. This includes understanding chains, agents (if applicable), document loaders, text splitters, embeddings, vector stores interface, and LLM integrations. Create a summary reference file named `docs/reference/langchain_summary.txt`.

### Critérios de Aceitação

- [ ] Official Langchain documentation website(s) (Python docs) identified and accessed.
- [ ] Key information relevant to the project (core components like chains, document loading, text splitting, embedding models, vector store interaction, LLM model usage within Langchain) reviewed.
- [ ] Focus on how these components are pieced together in `transcritor-pdf`.
- [ ] Summary reference file `docs/reference/langchain_summary.txt` created with key findings, architectural overview of Langchain usage in the project, relevant links, and illustrative code patterns.
