### Descrição

Research official documentation for Uvicorn. Identify key concepts, command-line options, programmatic usage, and configuration relevant to running the 'transcritor-pdf' FastAPI application, especially in a Docker environment. Create a summary reference file named `docs/reference/uvicorn_summary.txt`.

### Critérios de Aceitação

- [ ] Official Uvicorn documentation website(s) identified and accessed.
- [ ] Key information relevant to the project (running FastAPI apps, command-line arguments for host, port, workers, reload, SSL (if relevant in future), programmatic server startup, integration with FastAPI CLI) reviewed.
- [ ] Focus on recommended settings for production (e.g., number of workers) and development.
- [ ] Summary reference file `docs/reference/uvicorn_summary.txt` created with key findings, relevant links, and command/code examples.

### Arquivos Relevantes

* `ROADMAP.md` (Phase 7, 8)
* `requirements.txt` (uvicorn is part of fastapi[standard])
* `Dockerfile`
* `src/main.py` (if programmatic startup is considered)
* `docs/reference/uvicorn_summary.txt`
