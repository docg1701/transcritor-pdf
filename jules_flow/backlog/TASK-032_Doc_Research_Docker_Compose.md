### Descrição

Research official documentation for Docker and Docker Compose, focusing on best practices for containerizing a Python/FastAPI application and orchestrating it with other services (like PostgreSQL/Redis) as planned for the 'transcritor-pdf' project and its integration with `modular-dashboard-adv`. Create a summary reference file named `docs/reference/docker_compose_summary.txt`.

### Critérios de Aceitação

- [ ] Official Docker and Docker Compose documentation websites identified and accessed.
- [ ] Key information relevant to the project (writing Dockerfiles for Python apps, multi-stage builds, optimizing image size, Docker Compose syntax for defining services, volumes, networks, environment variables, and managing dependencies between services) reviewed.
- [ ] Understand how the `transcritor-pdf` service will fit into the `modular-dashboard-adv`'s `docker-compose.yml`.
- [ ] Summary reference file `docs/reference/docker_compose_summary.txt` created with key findings, best practices, links, and example snippets for Dockerfile and Docker Compose configurations.

### Arquivos Relevantes

* `ROADMAP.md` (Phase 8)
* `Dockerfile`
* `.dockerignore`
* `docker-compose.yml` (from `modular-dashboard-adv` once integrated)
* `docs/reference/docker_compose_summary.txt`
