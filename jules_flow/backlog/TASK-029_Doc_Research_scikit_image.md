### Descrição

Research official documentation for scikit-image, focusing on the specific image processing functions used in the 'transcritor-pdf' project (e.g., Deskew, Grayscale, Median filter, CLAHE, Sauvola thresholding). Understand their parameters, effects, and best practices. Create a summary reference file named `docs/reference/scikit_image_summary.txt`.

### Critérios de Aceitação

- [ ] Official scikit-image documentation website(s) identified and accessed.
- [ ] Key information relevant to the project's image processing pipeline (functions for deskewing, color conversion, noise reduction, contrast enhancement, binarization) reviewed.
- [ ] Understand the typical order of operations and parameter tuning for these filters.
- [ ] Summary reference file `docs/reference/scikit_image_summary.txt` created with key findings, links to specific function docs, and brief examples of their usage.

### Arquivos Relevantes
